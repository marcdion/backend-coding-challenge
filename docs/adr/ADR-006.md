# Nondeterministic algorithm - 07/03/2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Typical algorithms are deterministic, meaning that for a given input, the same result will be given back to the user every single time. Sometimes, as it is the case in this problem, the results change over time.

## Decision

By adding a popularity factor to my scoring strategy, the algorithm becomes non deterministic. Everytime a location is suggested, it's populatiry increases so the score assosciated with this value is also improving. I believe that this is a more realistic autocomplete feature since the algorithm should be partly based on the popularity of an element while it is trying to determine it's score.

## Consequences
