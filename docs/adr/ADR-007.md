# Diacritics support - 07/03/2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Debating on supporting diacritics or not (special characters, accents, etc.)

## Decision

One of my goals was to make my suggestion algorithm diacritic insensitive, which would basically mean that input "Québec" would return "Quebec" and vice-versa. I could not find an efficient way to support this functionnality across multiple dialects so instead of doing a half ased job, I decided not to implement this feature. 

It would of been easy for me to treat the special case I am used to in the french language (Àà, Ââ, Ææ, Éé, Èè, Êê, Ëë, etc) but this limits the scalability of the algorithm if we one day want to support other languages.

A potential way of solving it would be to include the users language in the query to better evaluate the diacritics (this is how Google manages to do it).

## Consequences

This makes the searchs error tolerance a little lower, but at least we have not implemented a half baked feature just for the sake of it.
