# Scoring strategy - 06/03/2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This scoring strategy is used to sort suggestions by relevancy

## Decision

The scoring strategy has two possilble outcomes. It all depends if a latitude and a longitude is passed in the query. If the location is not passed, the scoring algorithm will be based on three parameters:

 - Base score
 - Popularity (number of times the result was searched)
 - Edit distance

 If a location is passed, it is also factored in to the overall weight of the suggestion. See the documentation on the Scoring to get more info.

## Consequences

Having multiple parameters can make implementation more complicated. But it allows for greater accuracy.
