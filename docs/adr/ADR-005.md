# API Versioning - 06/03/2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Why I chose to do the API versioning via the HTTP headers

## Decision

To keep the query format as close to the example demonstrated in the README, I decided to add the API version into the request headers instead of in the query format like so:
/v2/suggestions?q=londo.

## Consequences

API versions can not be easily tested directly from the browser. Althought the API uses the newest version by default if one is not given in the headers, you need to use a program like Postman to manually
set other versions for testing
