# Selecting Trie as data structure - 03/03/2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A Trie, also know as a Prefix tree, was used to store and query geo names.

## Decision

A trie isn't the most obvious data structure to be used in this situation, but I believe it is the most efficient way of accomplishing the most efficient search. Although filling a Trie is a lot slower than let's say a Hash table (about 400x according to my calculations), the query time is a lot faster (around 100 times quicker). This is benficial since filling the Trie only happens when the application is initialized where as query is executed every time we want to suggest some data to the user. Tries can also be efficient on memory, especially when compression is possible (in the case where the end of a word is far from the nearest prefix, all the chars can be grouped into one node).

## Consequences

Tries are obviously a lot harder to understand and comprehend than a Hash table or a list. The operation of filling the Trie is also less efficient.
