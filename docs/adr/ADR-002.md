# Adding base score to record - 03/03/2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

It has been decided that a base score will be attributed to each GeoName in the list to improve performance

## Decision

To further increase performance while fetching data in the prefix tree, a base score is added to the record before it is inserted. This score is calculated by dividing the population of the geographic location by the most populous city in the locations. This gives us a base score between 0 and 2 because we divide the highest population by 2. So the highest on the ceiling would give 2/2. By logic, it is assumed that a location that is more highly populated will be more interesting therefor more searched. Since we will be using a Depth first traversal Preorder search to search the tree, records inserted first will ultimately be queried first.

## Consequences

Extra ressources have to be spent reordering the list. It is costly in the begining but it will be worth it when queries are being executed. Since Linq OrderBy uses Quicksort, the time complexity for the worst case scenario is O(n^2)
